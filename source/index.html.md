# Welcome to Winux!

We are connecting people in order to create a OS that is simple flexible and rock solid as well as we are creating the field for discussion about the OS concepts UI/UX solutions.

### Clear code with the best documention ever

For us the user is in the center and he/she decides what the computer does, therefore he/she should be able to easily adopt to her/his work flow, so the OS does what he/she wish to. We are trying to create supporting comunity, create content and teach people to use advanded features of the os 

### Our way

We do not try to create OS that is compatible with existing solutions like Unix, UI interfaces etc. The OS is flexible works well and smooth and everything is tightly join together. The OS is rooling release distro, that delivers nonbraking changes without giving time the developers to adjust theirs software.

The OS is ment for single user and tries to give him full control over processes.

Currently the base for the os is Debian sid with no gui. Our software is placed in `/winux` directory. We are focusing on Swift for for public stable long supported API and Rust/C/C++ language in coding lower level libs that are used internally and might contains breaking changes
