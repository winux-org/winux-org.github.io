# Welcome to Winux!

We are connecting people in order to create a toy OS that is easy to understand as well as we are creating the field for discussion about the OS concepts.

### Clear code with the best documention ever

For us the user is in the center and he/she decides what the computer does, therefore he/she should be able to easily understand the code and change it, so the OS does what he/she wish to. 

### Our way

We do not try to create OS that is compatible with existing solutions like Unix, UI interfaces etc. The OS is field for testing ideas and have fun. The fun is our goal.
