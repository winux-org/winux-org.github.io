# The keyboard shortcuts mess

Keyboard shortcuts enable the users perform actions faster, but in the Linux world it is quite painful. For example, coping in some applications is done by `ctrl`+`c`, but in others by `shift`+`ctrl`+`c`. The user needs to focus first on what app he is using instead of what he wants to do.

Our rolution is to create list of shortcuts and enforce them.

## `Alt` - Indepandent

Independent on what app is currently focused

- `Alt` `1-9` - Change workspace
- `Alt` (`→`, `←`) - Switch workspace 
- `Alt` `L` - Search in bookmarks of open url in surf (or other webbrowser)
- `Alt` `Shift` `Enter` - Span new terminal 
- `Alt` `Shift` `Q` - Logout, quit desktop environment
- `Alt` `Swift` `D` - Lock screen
- `Alt` `P` - App launcher
- `Alt` `O` - Search for file to open
-  ` - General search
- `Alt` `Shift` (`↑`, `↓`) Vomume up 

## `Alt` - Extra

- `Alt` `Tab` `A-Z` - Open program in empty workspace that is assigned to the letter or switch to workspace where the program is opened
- `Alt` `Tab` `P` - Web browser - Search page
- `Alt` `Tab` `E` - Web browser - Defadult plain text editor
